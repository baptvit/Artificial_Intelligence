# Learning Data Science

#### Course base

This is the Curriculum for [Learn Data in 3 Science Months](https://youtu.be/9rDhY1P3YLA) by Siraj,[Dreams in the CodingTrain](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Machine-Learning)  Raval and [Roadmap: How to Learn Machine Learning in 6 Months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOdlp1d0PNA) by Zach Miller. 

# Resource attributes

Since resources across the internet vary in terms of their pre-requisites and general accessibility, it is useful to
give attributes to them so that it is easy to understand where a resource fits into the wider machine learning scope. Below is a few suggested attributes (please extend):
 
 - :blue_book: = Doing
 - :heavy_check_mark: = Completed
 - :rainbow: = creative
 - :bowtie: = beginner
 - :sweat_smile: = intermediate, some pre-requisites
 - :godmode: = advanced, many pre-requisites


#### Tools Used
- Python, SQL, R, Tensorflow, Hadoop, MapReduce, Spark, GitHub, Excel

### Accelerated Learning Techniques
- Watch videos at 2x or 3x speed using a browser extension
- Handwrite notes as you watch for memory retention
- Immerse yourself in the [community](https://medium.com/@exastax/top-20-data-science-blogs-and-websites-for-data-scientists-d88b7d99740)
