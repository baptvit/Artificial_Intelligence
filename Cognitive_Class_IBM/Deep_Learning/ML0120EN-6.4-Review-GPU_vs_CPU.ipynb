    "#### Performance of GPU vs CPU\n",
    "Most of Deep Learning models, especially in their training phase, involve a lot of matrix and vector multiplications that can parallelized. In this case, GPUs can overperform CPUs, because GPUs were designed to handle these kind of matrix operations in parallel!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why GPU overperforms?\n",
    "A single core CPU takes a matrix operation in serial, one element at a time. But, a single GPU could have hundreds or thousands of cores, while a CPU typically has no more than a few cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to use GPU with TensorFlow?\n",
    "It is important to notice that if both CPU and GPU are available on the machine that you are running a noebook, and if a TensorFlow operation has both CPU and GPU implementations, the GPU devices will be given priority when the operation is assigned to a device. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, as we are running this notebook on [IBM PowerAI](http://cocl.us/SETI-NIMBIX-PowerAI), you hvae access to multi GPU, but lets use one of the GPUs in this notebook, for the sake of simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is XLA?  \n",
    "XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) is a domain-specific compiler for linear algebra that optimizes TensorFlow computations. The results are improvements in speed, memory usage, and portability on server and mobile platforms. Initially, most users will not see large benefits from XLA, but are welcome to experiment by using XLA via just-in-time (JIT) compilation or ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation. Developers targeting new hardware accelerators are especially encouraged to try out XLA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The XLA framework is experimental and in active development. In particular, while it is unlikely that the semantics of existing operations will change, it is expected that more operations will be added to cover important use cases. The team welcomes feedback from the community about missing functionality and community contributions via GitHub."
